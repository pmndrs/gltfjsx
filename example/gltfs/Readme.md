In case you were wondering Monkeys.gltf and MonkeysLit.gltf were exported from blender.

Used Simple Bake plugin to create models with baked lighting (Wold backgound set to hdr image).

Monkeys.gltf has the shader for each object set to Background Shader. As such lighting in scene is ignored.

MonkeysLit.gltf has shader set to Principled Shader and includes lights. As such lighting in scene is used.
